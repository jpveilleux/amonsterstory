#A Monters's Story

This is the repo for the __[Fuck This Jam](http://bmo.fuckthisjam.com/)__ entry I am working on.

The basic idea of "A Monster's Story" is to recreate a game genre I hate(don't like all that much at least) within the 7 days of the event.

##The Story

You are a poor monster that is stranded on an alien world without any means of escape... To make matters worse, this planet has reduced your powers to a minimum. To regain your former formidable strength, you will need to fight enemies and learn new tricks.


##Genre & Mechanics

This game is a __JRPG__ or Japanese Role Playing Game. The difference between a western style RPG and a Japanese RPG is that in a JRPG, ususally, you have a character or band of characters that run around a map from one place to another and have random encounters that revolve around turn based battles. I know, I know, I just made a humongus generalization of JRPGs but this is the basis of 8-bit JRPGs and that is what I decided to make.


##Tech Used

At first I wanted to make this game in Java with the use of either Slick2D or LibGDX but my knowledge of Java is far too poor and I am way too early in my learning to get anything remotely playable by the end of the 7 days. I thus decided to move to more familiar grounds and create the game using ImpactJS. __[ImpactJS](http://impactjs.com/)__ is a fantastic framework to create canvas based games using __JavaScript__ and __HTML5__.
